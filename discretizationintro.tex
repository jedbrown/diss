The flow of ice sheets and especially outlet glaciers like Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} presents several challenges to mathematical analysis and numerical methods.
The ``shallow'' continuum forumlations traditionally used in glaciology, as well as the stronger results in mathematical analysis and convergence of numerical methods, require assumptions that do not hold for more demanding ice flow problems.
Weaker assumptions that remain physically valid for the problems of interest require substantially more technical analysis.
This analysis often takes place on the ``purer'' side of applied mathematics, and is thus quite far removed from glaciology.
This section surveys the known results on several technical matters and explains how they relate to problems of interest in glaciology.
