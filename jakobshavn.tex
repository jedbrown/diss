Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae} is representative of many similar outlet glaciers which control the response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to changing climate.
Understanding the effect of changing boundary conditions, especially ocean conditions near the grounding line and subglacial processes influenced by surface melt, is critical for predictive modeling of ice sheets.
