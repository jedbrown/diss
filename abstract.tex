A large amount of scientific effort worldwide is focused on understanding and predicting the advance and consequences of climate change, due to its potentially disastrous affects on human society.
Numerical models are playing an ever-increasing role in the analysis of complex processes, but current modeling approaches are limiting the scope of problems that can be addressed.
With the ever-increasing complexity, it is difficult to verify correctness of the implementation, assess accuracy of the simulation, or distinguish between numerical and modeling errors.
The established strategies for model coupling, while generally thought to be necessary in order to manage complexity, cause significant stability and accuracy problems.
Efficiency of nonlinear solvers represent a further obstacle to high resolution and advanced analysis techniques such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, and stability analysis.
Present implementations also tend to use low-order discretizations which poorly utilize emerging hardware, are low accuracy, and cause numerical artifacts in some cases.
This thesis contains contributions to each of these challenges.
Software contributions include a new library for high order finite element methods with native support for code verifiability throughout the development cycle, and numerous features in the {\PETSc} library, especially regarding implicit solvers for tighly coupled, indefinite, and mixed-type problems, interfaces for maintainable development of multiphysics code, and time integration for differential algebraic equations and systems requiring strong stability properties.
Theoretical contributions include investigation of regularity and discretization constraints for robust ice flow simulation and a new conservative formulation for polythermal ice.
The objective of this thesis is not to make a specific prediction, but rather to improve the methods and software tools available for future predictive modeling, especially by glaciologists less concerned with numerical and computational issues.
